## Trek Notes is a simple notes taking web application project from Laravel 9x, Breeze. 
Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications. Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

On this project I emphasize some important keys when building web application with Laravel, such as:

- Using Breeze for authentication.
- Model and migration.
- Resource controller for CRUD.
- Components and directive.
- Soft deleting models.
- Route model binding.
- Naming conventions and best practices.

## Other project features for completion
- Notebooks organizer
- Public note
- Search feature
- ect.,

## Reference and more details to be added timely.
